## API Endpoints

### Public (for n8n/external)
```
GET  /api/barbers              - List barbers
GET  /api/services             - List services
GET  /api/availability         - Check availability
POST /api/appointments         - Create booking
POST /api/ingest               - Log events
GET  /api/events               - SSE stream
GET  /api/kpis                 - Get metrics
```

### Internal
```
POST /api/auth/register        - User registration
POST /api/onboarding           - Tenant creation
GET  /api/customers            - List customers
```

## Database Schema

### 12 Tables
1. **tenants** - Organizations
2. **user_accounts** - Users
3. **tenant_users** - User-tenant-role relationships
4. **barbers** - Staff members
5. **services** - Service catalog
6. **customers** - Customer directory
7. **appointments** - Bookings
8. **events** - Event log (for metrics)
9. **schedule_rules** - Barber hours
10. **time_offs** - Vacations
11. **api_keys** - API authentication
12. **sessions** - Auth sessions (managed by NextAuth)

---

## Smart Availability System

### How It Works
1. Takes date, time, duration, timezone, optional barber
2. Converts to UTC for database queries
3. Checks schedule rules for weekday/time
4. Checks for overlapping appointments
5. Checks for time-off periods
6. Returns first available barber or suggests alternatives

### Auto-Assignment
- If no barber specified, finds first available
- Respects skills/services (configurable)
- Returns 409 if no one available

---

## Real-Time Features

### Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Dashboard connects to `/api/events`
- n8n posts to `/api/ingest`
- Events broadcast per tenant
- Live feed shows last 10 events

### Event Types
- `call_received`
- `booking_parsed`
- `availability_checked`
- `booking_created`
- `sms_sent`
- `error`

---
