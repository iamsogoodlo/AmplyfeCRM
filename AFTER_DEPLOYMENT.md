# What To Do After Vercel Deployment

Your code is live on GitHub: https://github.com/iamsogoodlo/AmplyfeCRM

Follow this guide **after** you deploy to Vercel.

---

## âœ… Step 1: Verify Deployment (2 minutes)

After Vercel finishes deploying (2-3 minutes), you'll get a URL like:
**https://amplyfe-crm.vercel.app**

### Test Login
1. Visit your production URL
2. Login with:
   - **Email:** demo@salon.com
   - **Password:** password123

3. You should see the dashboard!

---

## âœ… Step 2: Test Core Features (5 minutes)

Click through each page to verify everything works:

### Dashboard
- Should show KPI cards (all zeros is normal)
- Live feed section visible
- No errors

### Calendar
- Week view loads
- Shows Mon-Sun
- Empty is normal (no bookings yet)

### Bookings â†’ New Booking
**Create a test booking to verify everything works:**

1. Customer Name: "Test Customer"
2. Phone: "(555) 123-4567"
3. Service: "Haircut" ($30, 30min)
4. Barber: Leave empty (auto-assign)
5. Date: Pick tomorrow
6. Time: Pick 3:00 PM
7. Click **Create Booking**

âœ… Should redirect to bookings list and show your booking!

### Customers
- Should show "John Doe" (from seed data)
- Should show your "Test Customer" (from booking)

### Staff
- Should show 3 barbers: Alex, Jordan, Taylor
- Each with different colors

### Services
- Should show 4 services with prices

**If all pages load and you created a booking successfully, your app is fully working!** âœ…

---

## âœ… Step 3: Test API Endpoints (5 minutes)

The API is what n8n will use. Test it works:

### A. Get Services
```bash
curl https://amplyfe-crm.vercel.app/api/services \
  -H "x-api-key: sk_a97d25d11de6a69d864b833b64093def8ae4c50f643a6a46ed4f7c4d9f68946e"
```

Should return JSON with 4 services.

### B. Check Availability
```bash
curl "https://amplyfe-crm.vercel.app/api/availability?date=2025-11-10&time=3:00%20PM&duration=30&timezone=America/Toronto" \
  -H "x-api-key: sk_a97d25d11de6a69d864b833b64093def8ae4c50f643a6a46ed4f7c4d9f68946e"
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "available": true,
  "barberId": "...",
  "alternatives": []
}
```

### C. Create Booking via API
```bash
curl -X POST https://amplyfe-crm.vercel.app/api/appointments \
  -H "x-api-key: sk_a97d25d11de6a69d864b833b64093def8ae4c50f643a6a46ed4f7c4d9f68946e" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customer": {
      "name": "API Test",
      "phone": "(555) 999-8888"
    },
    "serviceId": "demo-service-0",
    "date": "2025-11-10",
    "time": "4:00 PM",
    "source": "PHONE"
  }'
```

Should return the created appointment!

**Refresh your dashboard** - you should see the new booking appear!

## âœ… Step 4: Connect n8n (10 minutes)

Now connect your n8n workflow to production.

### Update n8n Environment Variables

In your n8n instance settings:

```bash
CRM_URL=https://amplyfe-crm.vercel.app
CRM_API_KEY=sk_a97d25d11de6a69d864b833b64093def8ae4c50f643a6a46ed4f7c4d9f68946e
```

### Import Workflow Template

1. In n8n: **Workflows** â†’ **Import from File**
2. Select: `/Users/iamsogoodlo/salon-crm/n8n-workflow-example.json`
3. Workflow appears with all nodes configured

### Test the Workflow

1. Trigger the workflow manually or send test webhook
2. Check it:
   - âœ… Checks availability

3. Go to your CRM dashboard
4. Check **Live Feed** - should show events:
   - `call_received`
   - `booking_parsed`
   - `availability_checked`
   - `booking_created`

---

## âœ… Step 5: Configure for Your Salon (30 minutes)

5. Your new tenant is ready!

## âœ… Step 6: Optional - Custom Domain (5 minutes)

Want `crm.yoursalon.com` instead of `amplyfe-crm.vercel.app`?

### In Vercel:
1. Project â†’ **Settings** â†’ **Domains**
2. Add: `crm.yoursalon.com`

### In Your Domain Registrar:
Add this DNS record:
- **Type:** CNAME
- **Name:** crm

### Update Vercel:
1. **Settings** â†’ **Environment Variables**
2. Edit `NEXTAUTH_URL` â†’ `https://crm.yoursalon.com`

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

- Verify `NEXTAUTH_URL` matches your domain

### API Returns 401

- Verify `x-api-key` header is included
- Check key exists in database

### Bookings Fail
